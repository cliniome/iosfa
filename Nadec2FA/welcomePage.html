                <strong class="displayblock marginbot_5">Two-Factor Authentication</strong>
                A factor is a piece of information used to verify a person's identity for security purposes. The three most commonly recognized factors are:
            </p>
            <ul class="newlist">
                <li>
                    'Something you KNOW', such as a password or PIN
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Something you HAVE', such as a credit card or mobile phone
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Something you ARE', biometric data, such as fingerprint, retina
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
                In today's increased mobile users, traditional user login method of simple username and password is not secure enough anymore and poses high risk to corporate data. Two-factor authentication reduces such risk by introducing the dynamic password generated using OATH (Open Authentication) event-based and time based algorithms.
